## Description

This application helps people keep track of what they need to get done each day, and most importantly, actually get it all done. By tracking the current local time and color coordinating the schedule, the app keeps the user on top of their to-do lists. It can be tough to make sure you get everything done everyday, and it's even harder to be ontime. This app solves that. Creating this I learned more about jQuery, objects and value keys combos.

## Installation

Just open the URL above.

## Usage

Refer to the screen shot above, but to use this app you'll need to be able to type and click. Once the page is loaded, click into any of the text blocks, type any and all of the tasks you have for that hour block and then click the save icon to the right of the page.

## Credits

In addition to the jQuery documentation, I looked to sylviaprabudy on GitHub for ideas on how to access the specific block of text that corressponds to a specific save button and pass that to a variable.

## Features

JavaScript to color coordinate based on time and saving user input to local storage.

## Tests

Open the application and use Chrome Dev Tools to go to 'Applications' and ensure the app truly stores user input to the proper key and stores the right value.
